Libercoin
=============================

What is Libercoin?
-------------

Libercoin is the implementation of the Zerocoin protocol ( http://zerocoin.org ) guaranteeing true financial anonymity.

 - 2.5 minute block target
 - 21.6 million total coins hardcap
 - 100 coins per block as subsidy(currently @50/block)
 - Subsidy halves every 210,000 blocks (approximately 12 months)

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the libercoin client sofware, see https://github.com/libercoinofficial/libercoin/releases.

Libercoin is released under the terms of the MIT license. See `COPYING` for more
information or see http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.


Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Libercoin
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
[Slack : Libercoin Dev Channel](https://libercoin.slack.com/messages/dev/).

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/libercoinofficial/libercoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Libercoin.
